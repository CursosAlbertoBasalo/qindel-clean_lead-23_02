# Chain of Responsibility

## A list of classes that handle a process sequentially

In the Chain of Responsibility pattern each class can handle an object representing the process or pass it to the next class in the list.

API frameworks use this pattern to handle requests passing them through a list of middleware classes or functions. Some frontend frameworks also use this pattern to manipulate the request/respond cycle using interceptors.
